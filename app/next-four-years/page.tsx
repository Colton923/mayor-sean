              Over the next four years my job will be to build a stronger
              community by strengthening the entire community.

              In addition to completing current projects, maintaining our
              infrastructure and ensuring our city services are working nicely,
              I have additional plans.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              As I have publicly stated numerous times, I want to attack our
              housing crisis.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Currently, in Monmouth, we don't have enough housing, whether it
              be for ownership, or quality rentals. We have an aging housing
              stock and “zombie houses”, which accompany our lack of adequate
              housing. We all know people who work in Monmouth, but live out of
              the city and county. It would be better if they could live here.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              We need to keep people from moving away, as our population has
              shrunken considerably the past few decades. Less population equals
              less income for the city, schools, other taxing bodies, as well as
              our local businesses. It also lessens our pool of individuals to
              fill jobs.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Galesburg recently had a study done regarding their housing
              crisis, which puts us behind the 8-ball. They have a new,
              up-to-date, incredibly comprehensive plan to remedy their housing
              crisis. We need an action plan before we fall further behind, and
              more people move away.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />I want to appoint a task force to focus exclusively on the
              single issue of our housing crisis. We have people here in
              Monmouth that can deliver solutions, as we seek grants; work with
              legislators; lure investment; developers; and locals and outsiders
              to build, remodel and update housing. Those who can fix this
              problem are amongst us. A task force will work when done
              correctly, and it will be done correctly.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Another priority, we need to make a significant effort to develop
              the South side of town. Those living there have told me in every
              way possible, that they feel as if they have been ignored. And
              some people have told me in words I can't use here. One man gave
              me a hug and said, “Thank you for thinking about us.” I am
              thinking about him, and everyone else.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              My goal isn't to ignore one part of town in favor of another, my
              goal is to give the greatest effort in all parts of our wonderful
              town. The South side has so much to offer, and parts are like a
              blank canvas just waiting to be filled in. It is time to paint
              that canvas. People have been waiting for far too long.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              People should be proud not only of their town, but of their
              neighborhoods as well.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Next, I will work very hard to recruit small business and large
              business. I will urge large business to expand here – such as Big
              River Resources. As mayor, I will use every resource at my
              disposal to bring business to Monmouth.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />I heard during an interview that Monmouth is approached
              frequently by businesses looking to possibly locate here. We only
              see who has, not who has not. Every prospect will be given my full
              attention, as I wish to close the sale. Why leave town, when you
              can get it here? No one person has a monopoly on bringing business
              here, and I will prove that. And when I do, we will all benefit.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Another area of extreme importance to me is to create a culture of
              community service. I want to encourage the wonderful people of
              Monmouth to be more involved in their community. When people
              decide to give of themselves, Monmouth becomes stronger.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Anyone can do something to strengthen our town. It could be
              something as simple as donating to the Knights of Columbus Tootsie
              Roll Drive, which is quite important, or it could be organizing a
              group of people to assist in picking up litter in one of our
              parks. Perhaps you wish to donate a tree to the park district.
              FYI, the park district loves it when people donate trees – they
              can even help you pick one out.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              There is no limit to what people can do, when it comes to
              supporting their community. Some people donate funds, which is
              outstanding, and some people donate their time, which is just as
              outstanding.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              You may wish to run for office – school board, city council or
              another position. Don’t be afraid to be active, as you do have the
              courage to succeed.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              We can all contribute in one way or another. I do it all over the
              place – by choice. You can do it too, by choice. Please do. If you
              do, I promise, you will feel fantastic as a result, and Monmouth
              wins!
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              What I intend to do as mayor is not limited by what appears on my
              website or printed materials. I intend to be a mayor for all the
              people of Monmouth, which will involve all kinds of things – none
              of which I fear. I have immense political will, and I intend to
              use it.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              There is another important thing that the mayor does – he sets the
              tone. I want to be sure to set a tone of the importance of
              listening and encouraging people to work together.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />I want to set a tone for city employees as well as
              expectations that they will do their best in their work to serve
              the people that pay their salaries. I also want the city employees
              to know that am an employee-friendly mayor.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />I want a tone of outreach, where hopefully the city can find
              new ways to partner with the college, or businesses and churches
              to do even more together.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />
              Tone, I think, is important. Sean Cavanaugh is here for you, so
              you will not be ignored.
            </p>
            <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1 p-4"}>
              <br />I will be accessible and transparent. I will do what is
              necessary for all of Monmouth to succeed.
