                Given the demographics, what can the City of Monmouth do to
                ensure all residents have access to basic needs and quality of
                life?

                We all know Monmouth has changed quite a bit over the past
                several years. We have become much more diverse, and there are
                many among us who are in poverty, especially children. Rich or
                poor, newcomers or old-timers, we are all members of this
                community. My job as mayor is to focus on improving our
                community – safe streets, more jobs, more housing, maintained
                infrastructure, and also encouraging people on becoming more
                involved in Monmouth. I have maintained since day one, that all
                mayors need to encourage others to volunteer their time to
                organizations that offer hope and services to those in need.
                Everyone has the power to make a positive change. You could join
                a local service club, as they all work very hard to improve our
                beloved town. You could donate to a local nonprofit. You could
                visit Jeannie at the United Way of Greater Warren County, as she
                could certainly provide direction on what you can do. Whatever
                way you can imagine to help others, you can actually do it. You
                can donate your time, talents, or funds. It makes a difference
                and feels good. I do it all the time. Every year I freeze for
                food, I volunteer to help at the Prime Beef Festival, I
                volunteer with Merit Badge University, I've raised money for the
                cross-country team at the high school, so athletes with little
                money can have quality shoes. You can do it, too. Never sell
                yourself short, as you are far more powerful than you think. You
                could start by helping an elderly neighbor bring her recycling
                bin to the curb. You could go through your closet and remove
                clothing you haven't worn in a while, then donate them. There is
                so much you can do, and even do for free. You don't need to have
                wealth to make a positive change – I am living proof of that.

                Funding for capital improvements to infrastructure largely comes
                from state and federal grants. Please talk about your experience
                with successful grant applications, administering projects and
                submission of required reports.

                I certainly agree with the premise of the question – a
                successful local government has to be able to reach outside the
                community to find money for projects and improvements that we
                need. I have a lot of experience in grant writing, as it is a
                very important part of my job at Warren Achievement Center. I
                have been quite successful, as Warren Achievement Center needs
                those funds in order to operate at the level it has for decades.
                As mayor, I will work very hard to do the same. I will,
                naturally, utilize our City Manager, legislators and the entire
                Monmouth team to succeed in this area. This is an area where
                Monmouth College could also be involved. There many people in
                town who could walk into City Hall and write successful grants,
                and I am one of them. I would especially like to secure funds to
                improve Monmouth's South end of town. There is so much
                opportunity down there – it is a canvas just waiting to be
                painted. In speaking with residents, they feel they have been
                ignored for 20 years, while other areas of town are not.
                Everyone recognizes the need for a vibrant downtown, but we must
                honor those on the South side by providing their neighborhoods
                with aggressive attempts at development. That is an issue I am
                told about over and over, and over again.

              <p className="text-lg font-bold mt-2">
                In recent years, the city approved a housing development in the
                United school district. What programs/plans does the city have
                to increase housing offerings, or a housing development in the
                Monmouth-Roseville school district?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                I believe any mayor or city council would be happy to have more
                housing in Monmouth. And I truly understand the question about
                more housing in the Monmouth-Roseville school district. Schools
                need funds to operate and succeed. Property taxes are vital to
                the bottom line. At this very moment Monmouth is losing the
                housing war to our neighbor in Knox County. Galesburg just
                completed an extensive housing study, which was to define needs,
                projections, obstructions and solutions – both short-term and
                long-term. They will aggressively use the information from that
                study to solve the problems facing them regarding housing. They
                already have certain advantages over us, and now they will have
                more if nothing is done. We all know people who work in
                Monmouth, but live outside of town, and even outside Warren
                County. This must change, or we will see our population to
                continue to decrease, which will place a strain on all entities
                relying on property tax revenue – including the
                Monmouth-Roseville school district. When schools are not funded
                adequately, a whole host of problems can arise. Our current
                housing stock is aging. There is a demand for both new and
                rehabilitated housing – focusing on affordability and
                demographics, such as seniors, retirees, and families. There is
                also a demand for quality rental, in addition to home ownership.
                Housing is one of many challenges Monmouth faces, and I look
                forward to taking it on – head on. I will appoint a special task
                force of committed individuals to help tackle the problem. Some
                people feel a task force is a last resort with little hope, but
                it isn’t when you have the right people involved. Then it
                becomes a success.

                Do you have any plans to rehabilitate existing housing stock
                that has gone into disrepair? If so, are there specific plans
                and a time-line for the rehabilitation to start?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                Yes, I do. When I served on Davenport's Abandoned Housing Task
                Force, I learned very quickly about the pitfalls of abandoned
                and condemned structures. First, it costs an absolute fortune to
                tear down a house. Second, such structures bring down the
                property values of neighboring properties. Third, nothing good
                happens in an abandoned property. I believe Monmouth has around
                25 of these properties, which are referred to as “zombie
                houses”. Those houses might be in the process of foreclosure, or
                in the process of being condemned, or could have already been
                foreclosed upon or condemned. A bank or lender typically owns a
                foreclosed home. This happens when a homeowner defaults on their
                mortgage and the lender takes ownership of the property. Lenders
                usually try to sell foreclosed homes quickly, perhaps even at a
                discount. With a condemned house, the homeowner owns it until
                the city takes control of it. The city takes control when the
                homeowner is unable to fix or maintain the property, based on
                various conditions. The process of foreclosure or condemnation
                can take a bit of time, but eventually one conclusion or another
                does arrive. If a house is condemned, it does Monmouth zero good
                to hold on to these properties. As mayor, I will make it as easy
                as possible for someone else to own them – with strings
                attached. The prospective owner would need to prove they have
                financing and plans for rehabilitation. They may even wish to
                demolish it and build new on the site. If more than one
                person/entity/developer in interested, there could be a bid
                process or auction. Prices would start at $1. I know of people
                this very second that would love to take advantage of that
                program. We need those properties to be back on the tax rolls
                and out the city's hands. As far as a time-line is concerned, I
                would say as soon as humanly possible.

                Every immigrant population goes through a generational process
                of assimilation. The first generation continues its own
                language, culture, and identity; the second generation holds
                onto the language, culture, and identity of their parents while
                embracing those of the native population; and the third
                generation largely identifies with the native population.
                Unfortunately, there is such thing as "downward assimilation,"
                in which the second and third generation become trapped in the
                same cycle of poverty and crime as some of the native
                population. This is caused by segregation, poverty, weak
                community structures, and lack of opportunities. How will you
                help the second and third generation of immigrants in Monmouth
                to integrate and assimilate in a way that ensures upward
                mobility?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                We have always been a welcoming community and I want that to
                continue. The best way, for a mayor, in my view, to give
                newcomers the best chance to succeed and contribute would be to
                grow our tax base, improve housing, recruit business, and
                maintain infrastructure. By doing that, our schools can have
                more resources to provide quality education and teach new
                skills, which benefit the immigrant population. More housing
                would allow more workers at Smithfield to live where they work,
                instead of commuting from somewhere else. I knew a hard-working
                fellow who was commuting from Beardstown for goodness sake. I
                would also encourage our immigrant population to become involved
                in Monmouth, whether be it in our schools, churches or numerous
                service organizations. Take schools for example, the more
                involved a person is, the more integrated they are – no matter
                where they are from. But to address your question, immigrants
                involved in, let’s say, cross country and theater become part of
                a team – they are depended upon, they contribute and are
                appreciated for it. They will be seen as friends, teammates, the
                person who just won a medal, the person who learned to push
                themselves, the person who helped a buddy with homework, the
                person who is an artist in the making, the person with
                increasing confidence, the person who will succeed. Schools
                provide many positive things, especially for those seeking
                opportunity and inclusion. Give the effort, gain the reward. I
                can't speak for our Superintendent, but I think he would agree.
                As I stated earlier, the same can be said about churches, clubs
                and other organizations. Again, as mayor, I will work every
                single day to expand our tax base, grow housing, recruit
                business creating jobs, and maintain infrastructure. When I do
                that, there is more opportunity for the immigrant population to
                integrate, assimilate, and be provided the best chance for
                upward mobility.

                In what way (if any) should city resources (funding, police,

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                As mayor, I will be required to follow the law. Failure to do so
                would have dire consequences for me, and for Monmouth. Once I
                take the oath of office, I can't pick and choose what law can be
                enforced. I want to make sure that our police are prioritizing
                fighting crime, getting dangerous drugs off the street, and
                keeping us safe.

                I have been speaking to a lot of people, and yes, I have spoken
                to many members of the immigrant community. When I hear their
                stories, they remind me of my mother and father. They are hard
                workers who wish for their children to have better opportunities
                then they themselves have had. They have strong families and
                help make a strong community. When we have a strong community,
                everyone benefits. Many of the immigrant community have come
                from harsh circumstances and see the American Dream as something
                to strive for. I can’t help but admire their work ethic, strong
                families, and the fact they wish for the American Dream. Not
                only do I care for their futures, but I care for their “right
                now”. They want better lives. I want a better life; don’t you
                want a better life? As mayor, I will do my best to provide them
                the best possible city for all of Monmouth to enjoy, including
                the immigrant population.

                In my 2+ years that I have been working here in Monmouth, I have
                seen a couple city projects still in the works to try and help
                the city look better or upgrade/refurbish. There are a lot of
                run-down homes in the city, and by the Midwestern Pet Food
                plants, that I have been told, and it is felt “push people away
                from wanting to live here and/or work here”. As a manufacturer
                in this town, we count on and need people locally to assist our
                business to grow. What will be done to make Monmouth more
                attractive and create a WANT for people to move here and make a
                life & how long of a road do you anticipate this to take? What
                is a realistic plan for growth, is larger industry coming a part
                of the plan and your strategy to achieve this over the next 5-10
                years?

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                The best way to make Monmouth more attractive, is for Mayor
                Cavanaugh to do my best to create a town that attracts those
                candidates. Maintaining infrastructure, conquering the lack of
                housing, keeping our town safe, expanding our tax base, and
                caring for our citizens will lure more people to live in
                Monmouth. We need to reverse our population decline. I would
                seek grants that could help Monmouth offer incentives to
                homeowners to make improvements on their property. With my work
                on Davenport’s Abandoned Housing Task Force, I can see there
                could be a way to do something similar in Monmouth regarding
                “run-down” homes. We also must understand that not everyone who
                owns a home can afford to spruce it up to another person’s
                liking. If they own the property, pay their taxes and follow the
                rules, then they are meeting the responsibilities of being the
                owner of the property. You also asked how long it would take to
                for a strategy to show results. That would depend on how
                aggressive a person, or group of people or local government is
                in tackling the problems of Monmouth. I can assure you that I
                will be jumping in the pool, head first, as soon as I become
                Mayor.

                The answer to this question is quite similar to your first

                skilled candidates for local industries, is to do their best to

                that quite a few folks have to travel from out of town to work
                at your place. We want them to live here, but we have that pesky
                housing shortage breathing down our necks. Sadly, you are not
                the only one who faces those challenges. Perhaps there is a way
                for you to collaborate with Carl Sandburg College or Monmouth
                College to develop quality candidates that can step directly in
                roles you have available. I know both colleges are keen on
                collaboration when it benefits their students and their
                community. I will always be available to you to discuss these
                issues further. I want you to succeed, just as I want everyone
                to succeed. That is what a good mayor does.

                What opportunities do you see for new ways to partner with
                Monmouth College to attract and retain new talent to our city?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                Personally, I have been always looking for ways to increase
                collaboration with Monmouth College. As a County Board member, I
                utilized professors and had them present to the board when
                advocating for wind turbines, which was most helpful. At Warren
                Achievement Center, where I work as Marketing Coordinator, I
                have partnered with Monmouth College for years. We take great
                pride in our college interns. We have had interns majoring in
                Marketing, Communications, Psychology, Exercise Science and
                more. A student named Anna Castor interned at our Day Program
                Facility. She was assisted in creating a program that slows the
                progression of dementia in some of our aging achievers. Now she
                runs the program. Additionally, when the second semester begins,
                Anna will be a paid employee, and will continue to run this
                important program. We are working with Dr. Shimmin in the hopes
                that Monmouth College can provide interns each semester to keep
                the program going indefinitely. When recruiting interns, I
                always ask them, “What would you like to appear on your resume?
                Let’s make it happen.” Our interns are provided opportunities to
                have real world experience they can take with them after
                graduation. Our interns are not to perform minor tasks that are
                meaningless to potential employers, we give them roles which
                will serve them well. Other businesses in Monmouth could do the
                same thing. Once it gets going, it benefits everyone. A
                successful hands-on approach could increase enrollment. This
                collaboration would allow talent to be created beyond the
                classroom. In addition, I am friends with the President of the
                University of Michigan. After I asked a favor from him, he
                agreed to speak with President Draves on how Monmouth College
                could form some sort of collaboration with the University of
                Michigan. Surely there is a way to make this happen. This could
                be most beneficial to Monmouth College. As Mayor, I will do
                whatever I can to help Monmouth College, as the college is of
                vital importance to Monmouth.

              <p className="text-lg font-bold mt-2">
                Monmouth economic development and beautification attracts
                citizens, students, and businesses to our town. The success of
                one area leads to the success of the others. First, can you
                share how the City partnering with the College, other agencies,
                businesses, and schools can help focus our efforts to update
                some of our aging storefronts and homes on our main streets
                which often are the first impression of our town. Second,
                provide one economic development idea you would love to focus on
                in the upcoming year.
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                Whenever the City and other entities develop a partnership, it
                is a good thing. Monmouth is old and we have many aging
                buildings that could benefit from structural and cosmetic work.
                The city currently has a façade program that provides matching
                funds to businesses is a small area downtown. I am not sure how
                much is spent on that each year, but it could always be
                increased. Ultimately, there can be partnerships to take on this
                problem, but it comes down to the almighty dollar. The city
                would need grant funds or other funds to beautify the area. That
                being said, there are other parts of town where businesses exist
                that would not have access to this program, regardless of need.
                Monmouth needs a plan that will be beneficial to all. As mayor,
                I will do my best to bring new businesses and employers to town,
                as that can spruce up aging buildings. There is also the TIF
                district in Monmouth, which is quite large. Businesses need to
                understand how it may benefit them. Property owners pay into the
                TIF district, but not all feel that it will ever benefit them
                directly, like it does others. The second part of your question
                was to provide one economic development idea. The South end of
                town hasn’t changed much over the last 20 years. Residents down
                there feel ignored, and quite frankly, have been. There is a lot
                of opportunity for developers, and I would like to see a maximum
                effort to provide development for those who are feeling left
                behind.

                Digital transformation is one of Monmouth College's priority
                pillars. The college is working to ensure every student is
                prepared for the digital economy and the rapid change that AI is
                and will continue to bring. How can we incentive young
                entrepreneurs to stay in Monmouth after their Monmouth College
                graduation to bring new businesses to our city?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                First of all, if we can’t turn around our housing problem, there
                will be few choices on where one can live in Monmouth, even if
                they want to stay. We need to win the housing war with our
                neighbors who are working this very moment at fixing their
                problem. That will be a priority of mine. Also, with the digital
                economy, many people are able to go to work in their own living
                room or home office. Employees and entrepreneurs working
                remotely should consider Monmouth after graduation, as it is a
                great place to live. The cost of living is affordable, and there
                are plenty of opportunities to get involved locally. Obviously,
                we have Monmouth College, which offers wonderful events
                throughout the year to enjoy. And I must say, football games at
                Bobby Woll Field are always a good time, and typically a win. As
                mayor, I will work to, without sounding like a broken record,
                create more housing, as well as recruit businesses – large and
                small. We need to expand our tax base and increase our
                population if we want money to spend on infrastructure,
                beautification, pension obligations and our other bills.

                Monmouth College has rich intellectual resources and most of our
                faculty and staff live in our town. How can we utilize these
                vast resources, resources that most rural Midwestern cities
                don't enjoy, to support the growth of Monmouth and enrich
                citizen's lives?
              </p>

              <p className={"mt-2 text-base indent-1"}>
                You are correct, Monmouth College does have vast resources that
                most rural towns don't have. The college already participates in
                internship opportunities, they allow high school events to take
                place on campus, employ many Monmouth residents, and more. I
                assume by your question, that you want to improve upon, or
                enhance current activity. First, I would suggest Mayor Sean
                Cavanaugh and President Patricia Draves have a meeting to
                discuss the future. The vast academic resources most certainly
                are of great value to the town of Monmouth, beyond the
                classrooms. In our meeting of the minds, we could discuss what
                Monmouth College faculty and student body is willing to do in
                regards to involvement in the local business community, the
                schools, other organizations, entities, and with individuals.
                What would be the best use of your vast resources and how they
                can be utilized? Professors and students could: · Offer advice
                on any number of topics · Aid in creating business plans for
                local upstarts · Providing marketing assistance to local
                businesses and organizations · Continue to assist with tax
                preparation · Market college events to all of Monmouth, and
                surrounding area, as there are so many great events for others
                to enjoy · Assist local businesses with social media · There is
                no end, as the imagination can create an endless list It would
                be a pleasure to work with President Draves to accomplish this
                goal.
