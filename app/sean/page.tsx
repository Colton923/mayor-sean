        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          I was born and raised in Monmouth by my parents, Mike and Nancy. After
          graduating from Monmouth High School, I attended Augustana College,
          earning a double major in Public Administration and Political Science.

        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          Following college, I moved to Chicago, working as a claims adjustor
          and accident investigator for an insurance company covering taxi cabs.
          This job provided invaluable lessons—working hard, being thorough,
          relying on facts, and standing firm.

          My career has strengthened my core skills—problem-solving,
          fundraising, delivering on promises, and community involvement. These
          experiences shaped me into who I am today.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          While living in Bettendorf, Iowa, I worked for two consulting firms
          with clients such as the Quad City River Bandits, Iowa Telecom, and an
          overseas client. I also served as the Director of Government Affairs
          for three REALTOR associations in Iowa.

            Recognized as someone who gets things done, I was invited to be
            involved in various initiatives, including:

          <ul className="mt-2 ml-6 list-disc text-gray-700">

        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          In 2008, after my parents passed away, I returned to Monmouth to
          settle their estate, intending to return to Bettendorf—but fate had
          other plans.

          The warmth of Monmouth’s community rekindled my love for my hometown.
          Soon after, I was asked to run for the County Board. After careful
          thought, I accepted.

        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          Serving for 15 years on the County Board—nearly 12 years as Chairman
          of the Buildings & Grounds Committee—I have led key initiatives,
          including the successful jail project referendum, which was once
          deemed unlikely.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-8 text-gray-700 max-w-xl mx-auto">
          Additionally, I served as Executive Director for the Warren County
          United Way, exceeding fundraising goals even during a recession. I
          currently work as a Marketing Coordinator for the Warren Achievement
          Center, which supports adults with developmental disabilities.
